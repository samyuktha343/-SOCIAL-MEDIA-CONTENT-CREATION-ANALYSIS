About The Project:

I worked for the Client named Social Buzz which is a Social media & content creation company to provide business insights on analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity to make the business decisions.Over 100000 posts per year and 36500000 pieces of content per year I anaylzed the 7 datasets provided by them and chose 3 datasets to make Data Model for this Project.

Implemented the Data Cleaning and Transformation and Merging the tables together using Power Query and Excel to do Data Analysis for Business Decisons and Insights.

The insights I got from this project is the top 5 popular content category based on their sentiment scores are based on Animals(21%),Science,Healthy Eating,Technology,Food from 16 Unique categories.Animals category reached the highest number of posts of 1897 indicating its popularity amomg other social media content categories.From the analysis May is the month where it reaches 2138 content posts which is 8% of total posts in a year with the help of Data Aggregation using Pivot Tables and Data Visualisations using Excel.This analysis shows that people enjoy "real-life" and "factual" content the most.Food is common theme in top 5 category we can create a campaign and work with healthy eating brands to boost user engagement.

My learning from this project is to derive business insights and to make effective business decisions to enhance the business needs.
